# Feature-Driven BottleNeck Framework (FDB)
This is a script containing the example on how the FDB framework works. 
You'll find the python script, followed by the different csv's containing the 208 extracted features and then the top-5 features found after performing the framework. 
This is not the final repo, we will update it with more information and friendly guides upon acceptance :) .
Thank you.
